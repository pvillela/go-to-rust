Pass 1 -- rewrite identifiers in AST:

    Preserve TypeSpec identifiers

        Prefix Field Name identifiers with "P__" if exported, transform the rest of the identifier to snake_case.

    Prefix FuncDecl Name identifiers with "P__" if exported, transform the rest of the identifier to snake_case.

    Preserve Field Type identifiers

    Transform all other identifiers to snake_case.

Pass 2 -- generate code:

    Generate structs
        
        Always make them pub

        Process fields:
            If the field begins with "P__", delete the prefix and generate "pub " in front of the field name

    Generate functions

        If the FuncDecl name identifier begins with "P__", delete the prefix and generate "pub " in front of the field name

    Generate other nodes by simply printing them

Caveats

    Be careful about type assertions: check them and return early as applicable.
